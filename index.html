            <h2>How to take better care of your Orchid</h2>

            <p>To provide an adequate environment for orchids to flourish, they need bright indirect light. Direct sunlight should be avoided as it can burn their leaves. Typically, in their natural habitat, they are found in forests and jungles, which is why humidity is also an important factor.</p>
